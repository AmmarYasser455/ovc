## Overview

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/assets/ov.png" alt="OVC Workflow" width="800"/>
</div>

OVC is designed to identify overlapping buildings, boundary violations, and road-related conflicts in geospatial datasets. It produces analysis-ready outputs and interactive web maps, making it ideal for real-world GIS quality assurance and data validation workflows.

The tool is built with modularity and extensibility in mind, allowing seamless integration into automated spatial data pipelines.

## Key Features

### Building QC
- **Overlap Detection** — Identify duplicate and partial overlaps in building geometries
- **Boundary Compliance** — Validate building footprints against administrative boundaries
- **Road Conflict Analysis** — Detect buildings conflicting with roads

### Road QC (New in v1.0.2)
- **Disconnected Segments** — Detect roads not connected to the network
- **Self-Intersections** — Find roads that cross themselves
- **Dangles** — Identify dead-end endpoints (incomplete digitization)

### Shared
- **Multi-Format Export** — GeoPackage, CSV, and HTML outputs
- **Interactive Visualization** — Web-based maps with legends
- **Modular Architecture** — Easily extend and customize workflows

```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

OVC can be run in multiple flexible modes depending on the data you already have. You do not need to write any Python code — just run a single command.

### ✅ Option 1: You have your own buildings only (no boundary required)

If you already have a buildings dataset (e.g., digitized manually or from another source), you can run OVC directly on it:

```bash
python scripts/run_qc.py \
  --buildings path/to/buildings.shp \
  --out outputs
```

**In this mode:**
- OVC uses your buildings as the analysis area
- Roads are automatically downloaded from OpenStreetMap using the buildings extent
- Building overlaps and building–road conflicts are detected
- No boundary checks are performed

This is the simplest way to run QC on local datasets.

### ✅ Option 2: You have your own buildings and roads

If you already have both buildings and roads datasets:

```bash
python scripts/run_qc.py \
  --buildings path/to/buildings.shp \
  --roads path/to/roads.shp \
  --out outputs
```

**In this mode:**
- OVC uses only your provided data
- No OpenStreetMap downloads are performed
- All overlap and road conflict checks are enabled

### ✅ Option 3: You have a boundary and want OSM data

If you provide a boundary file (e.g., governorate, district, or AOI), OVC will automatically download buildings and roads from OpenStreetMap:

```bash
python scripts/run_qc.py \
  --boundary path/to/boundary.geojson \
  --out outputs
```

**This mode:**
- Downloads buildings and roads from OSM
- Runs all QC checks, including boundary-related checks
- Requires the boundary to be a polygon (WGS84 recommended)

### ✅ Option 4: Enable Road QC (New in v1.0.2)

Add the `--road-qc` flag to also run road network quality checks:

```bash
python scripts/run_qc.py \
  --boundary path/to/boundary.geojson \
  --road-qc \
  --out outputs
```

**Road QC checks:**
- Disconnected road segments
- Self-intersecting roads
- Dead-end endpoints (dangles)

### ℹ️ Notes

- The boundary file must be a polygon geometry
- If `--buildings` is provided, OVC skips downloading OSM buildings
- If `--roads` is provided, OVC skips downloading OSM roads
- If no boundary is provided, OVC automatically derives the analysis area from the buildings extent
- Road conflict checks are always enabled when roads are available
- The `--road-qc` flag enables road network quality checks

## Outputs

Both modules produce outputs in a unified folder structure:

```
outputs/
├── building_qc/
│   ├── building_qc.gpkg          # GeoPackage with layers
│   ├── building_qc_map.html      # Interactive web map
│   └── building_qc_metrics.csv   # Summary metrics
└── road_qc/                      # Only when --road-qc is enabled
    ├── road_qc.gpkg
    ├── road_qc_map.html
    └── road_qc_metrics.csv
```

| Output Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **GeoPackage** | Spatial layers containing detected issues |
| **CSV reports** | Summary statistics and metrics |
| **HTML web map** | Interactive map for visual inspection |

All outputs are saved to the specified `output_dir`.
