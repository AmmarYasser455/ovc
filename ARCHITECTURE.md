## Separation of Concerns

OVC is intentionally split into clear, independent layers to maintain modularity and testability.

### `core/`

**Purpose:** Shared, low-level utilities and infrastructure

Contains:
- CRS handling and transformations
- Geometry helper functions
- Configuration objects
- Spatial indexing utilities

**Constraints:**
- ✅ Must remain domain-agnostic
- ❌ No QC-specific logic allowed
- ❌ No I/O operations

---

### `loaders/`

**Purpose:** Data ingestion and normalization

Responsible for:
- Reading input data (buildings, roads, boundaries)
- Schema normalization across different sources
- Reprojecting geometries to metric CRS
- Data preprocessing and cleaning

**Constraints:**
- ✅ Handles all data reading operations
- ❌ Does not perform validation or QC checks
- ❌ Does not contain business logic

---

### `checks/`

**Purpose:** Quality control logic and validation algorithms

Contains all spatial quality checks:
- Building overlap detection
- Boundary compliance validation
- Road conflict analysis
- Topological error detection

**Each check module:**
- ✅ Is deterministic and reproducible
- ✅ Accepts prepared GeoDataFrames as input
- ✅ Returns structured error outputs
- ❌ Does not perform I/O operations
- ❌ Does not load configuration directly

---

### `export/`

**Purpose:** Pipeline orchestration and output generation

Responsible for:
- Running the complete QC pipeline
- Writing results to disk (GeoJSON, CSV)
- Generating interactive web maps
- Producing summary reports

**Constraints:**
- ✅ Orchestrates the entire workflow
- ✅ Handles all output operations
- ❌ Does not contain QC algorithms
- ❌ Does not perform data validation

---

## Configuration vs Logic

A **strict separation** is enforced between configuration and business logic:

### Configuration (`core/config.py`)

Defines runtime behavior:
- User-adjustable parameters
- Threshold values (e.g., overlap tolerance)
- Output preferences
- System settings

### Logic (`checks/*`)

Implements algorithms:
- Geometry operations
- Spatial analysis
- Error classification
- Validation rules

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents tight coupling between parameters and implementation
- Allows algorithms to be tested independently
- Enables configuration changes without code modifications
- Supports multiple configuration profiles

---

## Backward Compatibility

OVC maintains backward compatibility through **configuration wrappers** that support legacy API usage.

### Legacy Support

Some configuration wrappers exist to:
- Accept deprecated parameter names
- Normalize arguments internally
- Preserve behavior for existing users

### Implementation

```python
# Example: Legacy parameter support
def run_check(data, overlap_threshold=None, threshold=None):
    # Normalize to current API
    active_threshold = threshold if threshold is not None else overlap_threshold
    # ... rest of logic
```

**Benefits:**
- Existing code continues to work
- APIs can evolve gracefully
- Core logic remains unaffected
- Clear deprecation path for future versions

---

## Design Principles

OVC follows these core architectural principles:

### 1. **Explicit over Implicit**
- Function parameters are clearly named
- Dependencies are explicitly passed
- No hidden global state

### 2. **Clear Module Boundaries**
- Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Cross-module dependencies are minimized
- Interfaces are clean and documented

### 3. **No Hidden Side Effects**
- Functions do not modify global state
- I/O operations are isolated to specific modules
- Pure functions whenever possible

### 4. **Testability over Convenience**
- Architecture prioritizes unit testing
- Modules can be tested in isolation
- Mock-friendly interfaces

### 5. **Backward Compatibility**
- Breaking changes are avoided when possible
- Deprecation warnings guide users to new APIs
- Legacy support is time-limited and documented

---

## Future Considerations

### Planned Improvements

**Short-term:**
- Deprecation of legacy configuration wrappers
- Migration to `union_all()` for geometry unions (performance improvement)
- Enhanced logging and error reporting

**Medium-term:**
- Additional QC checks as independent modules:
  - Self-intersection detection
  - Minimum area validation
  - Attribute completeness checks
- Plugin system for custom validators

**Long-term:**
- Distributed processing support for large datasets
- Real-time validation API
- Integration with external QC frameworks

## Contributing to Architecture

When proposing architectural changes:

1. **Open an issue first** to discuss the design
2. **Explain the problem** you're solving
3. **Consider backward compatibility** impacts
4. **Update this document** if your PR changes structure
5. **Add tests** that validate the new architecture
